# Chess, part 5

## Description
    This is a recreation of a game of Chess, played on the Windows command prompt.

    As I have expanded my knowledge and skills in coding, I have made many attempts at programming my own game of chess.
I do this as a test of skill, a learning experience, and a way to reinforce my knowlegde.
Parts 1, 2 and 3 were failures (albeit educational), and 4 was a minor success, all written in Java.
    For Part 5, I have decided to start from nothing in a new language (C++) in order to reinforce my conceptual knowledge, and to
learn a new language.

## Specifications:
    C++
    MVC Structure
    planned: Grammar verification and Transition Table

## Usage:
    Program displays a Chess board to the command line, and prompts the user for an input.
    Valid inputs are:
        <column letter><row number> <column letter><row number>
            to move from the first cell to the second cell
        "end"
            to quit the program
        "help"
            to receive a list of commands and their descriptions
